## **Usage**

Dynamic pages can be loaded by navigating to the following URLs:

| **Page**         | **URL**                  |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Home             | `/?page=home`           |
| Page 1           | `/?page=page1`          |
| Page 2           | `/?page=page2`          |
| Invalid Page     | Shows "Content not found" |

You can also use the **sidebar menu** to switch between pages dynamically.
